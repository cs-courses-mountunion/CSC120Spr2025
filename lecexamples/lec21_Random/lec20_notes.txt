To obtain unpredictable values, use an object of the Random class

    such an object has methods that return an unpredictable value of a certain data type


(1) Declare a Random object:

        private Random randGen;


(2) Instantiate the previously-declared object:

        randGen = new Random();        // truly random

        randGen = new Random( seed );  // seed is an integer; gives same values each time


(3) Use methods of the object:

        Integer x = randGen.nextInt( n );  // an unpredictable value in the range [0, n-1]
                    // here, n is the number of values in the range

        Double d  = randGen.nextDouble();  // an unpredictable value in the range [0, 1)

        Boolean b = randGen.nextBoolean();  // an unpredictable value of either true or false



The values returned by a Random object are UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED
    (meaning each possible result is equally likely to be returned)
