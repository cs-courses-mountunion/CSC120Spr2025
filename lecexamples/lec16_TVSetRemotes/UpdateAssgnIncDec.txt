Sometimes, we wish to use the current value of a variable in a calculation, 
    and store the result in that same variable

In effect, we are UPDATING the contents of the variable

With what we have studied so far in Java, we do this in the following manner:

    balance = balance + depositAmt;

    num = num - 56;

    x = x * 7;

    q = q / 5;

    z = z % 5;

This can result in a lot of typing with very long variable names:

    assetBalanceEndOfQuarter3 = assetBalanceEndOfQuarter3 * 0.75;

Java provides Update Assignment operators to do this without using the variable name twice

    assetBalanceEndOfQuarter3 *= 0.75;  

The previous examples could be rewritten as:

    balance += depositAmt;

    num -= 56;

    x *= 7;

    q /= 5;

    z %= 5;

================================

This gives us have two ways to add one to a variable:

    num = num + 1;

    num += 1;

Java defines a special operator that means "add 1 to", called the Increment operator:

    num++;

So there are three different but equivalent ways to add 1 to a variable.

Similarly, there are 3 ways to subtract 1 (the third way is to use the Decrement operator):

    number = number - 1;

    number -= 1;

    number--;
