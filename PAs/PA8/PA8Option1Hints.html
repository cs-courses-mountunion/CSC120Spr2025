<h4> Assume that your PA7 project contains the following array of Team objects that are instantiated in the program with these specific values: </h4>

<pre>
        Team[] teamList = new Team[12];
		
        teamList[0]  = new Team("Cleveland", "Browns", 6, 5);
        teamList[1]  = new Team("Indianapolis", "Colts", 6, 5);
        teamList[2]  = new Team("Tennessee", "Titans", 8, 3);
        teamList[3]  = new Team("Dallas", "Cowboys", 7, 3);
        teamList[4]  = new Team("Chicago", "Bears", 3, 7);
        teamList[5]  = new Team("Buffalo", "Bills", 6, 4);
        teamList[6]  = new Team("Kansas City", "Chiefs", 7, 4);
        teamList[7]  = new Team("Minnesota", "Vikings", 5, 5);
        teamList[8]  = new Team("Pittsburgh", "Steelers", 5, 4);
        teamList[9]  = new Team("Philadelphia", "Eagles", 5, 6);
        teamList[10] = new Team("New York", "Giants", 3, 7);
        teamList[11] = new Team("Cincinnati", "Bengals", 6, 4);
</pre>

<h4> For PA8, you would take this data and convert it into separate .txt file with the same information.&nbsp; Note that any String data
in quotes from the example above should be included in the .txt file WITHOUT the quotes!</h4>

<h4> Here's the data from above in a form that could be stored in a .txt file, using # as the delimiter between fields: </h4>

<pre>
        Cleveland#Browns#6#5
        Indianapolis#Colts#6#5
        Tennessee#Titans#8#3
        Dallas#Cowboys#7#3
        Chicago#Bears#3#7
        Buffalo#Bills#6#4
        Kansas City#Chiefs#7#4
        Minnesota#Vikings#5#5
        Pittsburgh#Steelers#5#4
        Philadelphia#Eagles#5#6
        New York#Giants#3#7
        Cincinnati#Bengals#6#4
</pre>

<h4> Once you have your .txt file, you must delete the separate instantiations of each element of the array from your PA8 code -- the array will be populated by reading the .txt file data from the input TextArea and using the Java .split method, in a manner similar to that seen in Lab # 12</h4>

<h4> Then make a second .txt file that is formatted exactly the same way as the first .txt file, but that contains specifically different data.&nbsp; Each of the two files MUST be different lengths (contain a different number of lines).
