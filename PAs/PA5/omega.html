<h2>CSC 120 Programming Assignment 5</h2>
</center>
</font>
<h4> Note:&nbsp; You should <b>not</b> work on this assignment during
lecture or lab class-time unless:
<ol type="a">
  <li>You have completed all of the in-class assigned work for the day,
and</li>
  <li>You have permission from the instructor.</li>
</ol>
</h4>
<h4> This assignment must be submitted to the PA5 D2L dropbox <b>before</b> the beginning of class on the due date.</h4>

<h3> Overview: </h3>
<blockquote> Write a Java application that plots the mathematical function <b><code>x = (5-y)*(5-y)</code></b>
             in a TextArea on screen, using
             a <code>for</code> loop; the plot is drawn in successive stages based on the
			 number of times the user has clicked on a button on screen.&nbsp; For an example
			 of how your program should work,

</blockquote>

<h3> Instructions and Requirements: </h3>
<ol>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <li>
    <p>Create an application called <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA5
    </span>(no
spaces in the name, so <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA5</span>,
not <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA 5</span>).&nbsp; This program will have only
two class definitions:&nbsp; the <code>MUFrame</code> class and the <code>MUPanel</code> class.&nbsp;
The GUI 
    for the program will have two <code>JButton</code>s and a <code>JLabel</code>, the behavior 
	of which will be defined below.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Copy the three files from <b>M:\CSIS\CSIS&nbsp;Faculty\Handout\NetBeansTemplates\MUFrame&nbsp;with&nbsp;GUI&nbsp;designer</b>
    	as a starting point for this program.&nbsp; Use the Designer to place two Buttons in the 
		bottom corners of the graphical output screen in MUFrame.java, and
		a Label in the bottom-center of the screen.&nbsp; Rename the buttons and label so that they have 
		meaningful names, change the text of the bottom-left button to be "Increase Repetitions", change
		the text of the bottom-right button to be "Reset Drawing", and change the text of the label 
		to be "Num. of Repetitions = 1".
	   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should declare a
	    private <code>Integer</code> property named <code>numberOfReps</code> in the MUPanel class.&nbsp;
		In the constructor method of <code>MUPanel</code>, store 1 as the initial
	    value of the <code>numberOfReps</code> property.
	   </p>
  </li>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  
  <li>
    <p>For this assignment, you only need to use an MUFrame class; you won't need an MUPanel, because
	   this assignment does not use graphics or drawing.<p>
  </li>
  <li>  
    <p>You should write a method in MUFrame that uses
       a <code>for</code> loop  that will append one line of the plot to the TextArea; the
       loop should be executed <code>numberOfReps</code> times.&nbsp; Before the
	   loop begins, use the <code>setText</code> method to display the title line in the 
	   TextArea, and after the loop ends, be sure to display the bottom axis as shown in the
	   samples.
	   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Note that in order to draw the asterisks for a particular line, you will need a <code>for</code>
	   loop.&nbsp; This means that your program will contain an outer <code>for</code> loop that
	   has an inner <code>for</code> loop inside it.&nbsp; This programming approach is called
	   using nested loops, and is a very common, important processing technique.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be two buttons in the interface &ndash; one that adds 1 to the
	   <code>numberOfReps</code> variable, and another that resets <code>numberOfReps</code>
	   to 1.&nbsp; When either of these buttons is clicked, the label at the bottom of the
	   screen must be updated to show the current value of <code>numberOfReps</code>, and
	   the plot method should be called so that the plot is redrawn in the TextArea showing 
	   the proper number of lines.
	</p>
  </li>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <li>
    <p>
	   Define three methods in the MUPanel class in addition to the constructor and <code>paintComponent</code>:
	   <ul>
	       <li> <code>increaseReps</code> &rarr; accepts no parameters and returns nothing.  This method should
                increase the value of the <code>numberOfReps</code> property by one. <br/><br/> </li>
	       <li> <code>resetReps</code> &rarr; accepts no parameters and returns nothing.  This method should
                store the value 1 in the <code>numberOfReps</code> property. <br/><br/> </li>
	       <li> <code>getNumberOfReps</code> &rarr; accepts no parameters and returns an <code>Integer</code>
		        value, which is the value of the <code>numberOfReps</code> property. <br/><br/> </li>
	   </ul>
	   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
       One of the buttons in the GUI should cause the value stored in <code>numberOfReps</code> to be
       increased by one by calling the appropriate method of the <code>muPanel</code> object, 
	   set the text of the label to "Num. of Repetitions = " + <code>muPanel.getNumberOfReps()</code>
	   and then <code>muPanel.repaint()</code> should be called.
	   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
	<p>
	   The other button should
       cause the value of <code>numberOfReps</code> to be reset to 1 by calling the appropriate method of
	   the <code>muPanel</code> object,
       set the text of the label to "Num. of Repetitions = " + <code>muPanel.getNumberOfReps()</code>
	   and then <code>muPanel.repaint()</code> should be called.
	</p>
  </li>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <li>
    <p>
       Each student in the class has a unique pattern to work on &mdash; you MUST use the pattern that
	   has been assigned to you for this project.	   
	</p>
  </li>
