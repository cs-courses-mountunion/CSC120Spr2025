<h3>Overview:</h3>

<blockquote>Write a Java Application program that plays a game that moves game pieces around a game
    board.&nbsp; This program will use an array of objects, each of which represents a player or game piece.&nbsp;
    Each game piece keeps track of the spot on the game board where it is located, and has
    methods to move and draw itself.&nbsp; You should have one object from a Background class
    that represents the game board.
</blockquote>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Create an application called <b>PA6.</b> It should contain two classes named <b>MUFrame</b> and 
	<b>MUPanel</b>.&nbsp; Start with the three files in the MUFrame&nbsp;with&nbsp;GUI&nbsp;designer
	.zip file available on the Student Resources page of the course web site.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>At a minimum, your application must be capable of playing a game
    between a fixed number of players.&nbsp; Game pieces will move
    in one direction from the starting point to the finish point or goal.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>The user interface should include a button that the user
    will click repeatedly to cause the game to proceed.&nbsp; Whenever the user
    clicks the button, all of the pieces in the game will take one turn in the game --
    the number of spaces a piece advances <u><b>must</b></u> be randomly determined.&nbsp; 
    Clicking the button repeatedly will cause the pieces to move toward the
    finish point until one or more pieces reaches the game's goal
    on a turn and wins the game.<br /><br />
    </li>
  
    <li>The program must be able to detect when one of the pieces in the array has reached the goal or won the
	game.&nbsp; Alternatively, the program could detect when one of the pieces has lost the game (fell in a pit,
	was eaten by a tiger, etc.).&nbsp; In other words, the program must be able to detect when the game is over.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>When the game is over, clicking the button should not cause any more movement of the pieces on the
	screen.&nbsp; This can be accomplished with a <code>Boolean</code> property that tracks whether the game is
	over or not.&nbsp; If the game is over, the pieces should not make any subsequent moves.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li><em> The game board: </em>
    <blockquote>
        You'll need a Background class or Board class.&nbsp; Instantiate one such object for the game board.&nbsp; In
		the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the MUPanel, draw the board first.
    </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li><em> The game pieces or players: </em>
    <blockquote>
        You'll need a GamePiece or Player class.&nbsp; Data members should include a color, integers
        to keep track of the piece's current position, a piece name or piece number, and perhaps
        other stuff if you see the need.&nbsp; Everyone should try to make their game pieces look
        different or unusual.&nbsp; This class will need some kind of method to make the object move on
		the screen somehow, and also a method for drawing the object.
    </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li><em> array of game pieces: </em>
    <blockquote>
        The MUPanel class must declare and use an array of players/pieces.&nbsp; Each piece keeps track
        of the space on the game board (or the over & down of) where it is currently located.&nbsp;
        At the start of the game, each piece should be drawn on its starting location.&nbsp;
        As the game progresses, each click of the button will cause all the pieces to take one 
        turn in the game.
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  
    <li><em> method in MUPanel called by the actionPerformed of the button in MUFrame: </em>
    <blockquote>
    Each time the button is clicked, the program must execute a loop that will cause
    each piece in the array to take a turn (move).&nbsp;  The number of spaces a piece moves should be 
    randomly determined.
    </blockquote>
	</li>

    <li><em> <code>paintComponent</code> method in MUPanel: </em>
    <blockquote>
        Ask the game board to draw itself, then use a loop to ask each of the pieces in the array
        to draw themselves.
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    
    <li><em> constructor method in MUPanel: </em>
    <blockquote>
        Instantiate the board object, instantiate the array of game pieces, and instantiate each
    the game pieces in the array.&nbsp; Be sure that the pieces are located at their appropriate starting
	locations.
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    
    <li>Don't forget your comment header for MUPanel, and put a comment header in each of the
        "background" and "player" class files.<br /><br />
    </li>

</ol>
    
<h3> Turning in your Program for Grading: </h3>
<blockquote>
  Convert your
<b>CSC120\Java\PA6</b> folder into a .zip file named <code><b>PA6.zip</b></code> and submit it to the PA6 dropbox
in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank"> D2L</a>.

<h3>Ideas for Enhancement of the Basic Requirements:</h3>
<blockquote>
Use your creativity to enhance the basic game.&nbsp;  Here are some suggestions
    for enhancing your game (you are not limited to this list - try things out!):
    <ul>
        <li> Choose game pieces that are rather complicated to draw (a car,
              a horse, etc.).  Or perhaps each piece in the game will have a different
             shape, like the different pieces in a game of Monopoly.<br><br>

        <li> Change the game board so that pieces
             don't always move in one direction throughout the game.&nbsp; For example, the
             game board might zig-zag across the screen from left to right, then right to
             left, etc. (think of the games Chutes and Ladders or The Game of Life),
             or might go around the screen as in a Monopoly game board.<br><br>

        <li> Keep track of the number of turns have been taken in the game, and 
             display that on the screen.<br><br>

        <li> Place an identifying number or label on each game piece when it is
             drawn on screen that isn't just a number from 1 to <em>n</em>.&nbsp;
             As an example, if
             you are a NASCAR fan, you could write a game that moves cars around a
             game board, and have the first car represent Kyle Busch #18, the second car be Dale Earnhart, Jr. #88, etc..<br><br>

        <li> Draw a game standings list in the Graphical Output window
             showing which player is in
             first place, second place, etc. at the current time.&nbsp;
               Update the standings each time
             the button is clicked.<br><br>

        <li> Set up different victory conditions -- rather than winning by reaching a particular
             spot on the board, a player might win by accumulating points.&nbsp; Landing on
             differently-colored board positions might earn different numbers of points, for
             example.<br><br>

        <li> Develop a game where a piece may have to move backwards a certain number
             of positions or return to
             the start position if it lands on a "penalty" position on the game board.
             &nbsp; When the game board is drawn, the "penalty" positions should be
             drawn differently from "normal" squares.<br><br>

        <li> Assess a penalty of some number of positions that a player will have to
             move backwards if the player lands on a game board position
             that is already occupied by another player's piece.<br><br>

        <li> Add "bonus" positions to the game board -- this means that if a piece lands
             on a "bonus" position, the piece may move some extra number of positions toward
             the final position for the game.&nbsp; Another idea would be to give a bonus
             number of moves to a player that rolls "doubles" in a two-dice game.<br><br>
			 
		<li> Maybe you could have different game boards/backgrounds for different "levels" of the
		     game -- when a player has reached the winning space on the board, the game "levels-up" to
			 the next game board/background.<br><br>
			 
		<li> You could use animation to cause the pieces to move without the need to click a "Take Next Turn"
		     button.&nbsp; Once the "Start Game" button is clicked, the game moves along by itself until
			 there is a winner.&nbsp; If you do this, be sure to use an appropriate delay so that
			 the game doesn't run too fast or slow.<br><br>

        <li> Implement some actual game that you have played and like.<br><br>

    </ul>

    There are many more fun things you could include in this project.&nbsp; Enjoy!
