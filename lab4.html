        This lab will give you experience with selection statements in Java:  the <em>if</em> and the
        <em>if/else</em> statements.<br>
<hr>
<ol>
   <li> Open the CodeWarrior IDE, and open the file named "CS121.html" in the CS121 folder of your
        Public.www folder.&nbsp; Copy the two lines in the editor window that look like this:
<pre>
    &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="lab2/TheApplet.html"&gt; Lab 2 &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="lab2a/TheApplet.html"&gt; Part a of Lab 2 &lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
        and then paste them into the editor window immediately after the &lt;strong&gt; line in
        the file.&nbsp; Change every occurrance of the digit "2" in the copied lines to "4".&nbsp;
        <br><br>
        What you've just done is to add two new links to your CS121 web page that will point to the
        projects you'll create in lab today.&nbsp; Every time you create a new project for this class,
        you should add a link to that project in the CS121.html file.
        <br><br>

   <li> Using the CodeWarrior IDE, create a new Default project in the CS121 folder of your 
            Public.www folder.&nbsp; Name the new projet <strong>lab4</strong>.&nbsp; Open the 
            file named "TheApplet.java", delete the entire contents of the file, and copy the
            contents of the program found by clicking <A HREF="lab4src1.html">THIS LINK</A>
            into the editor window.&nbsp; Examine this program, and notice that there are several
            <em> if </em> statements in the program.&nbsp; Try to predict what the output of the
            program will be, and then run the program to see if your prediction was correct.
            <br><br>

   <li> Change the values that are assigned to <em>num</em> and <em>text</em> so that 
            there are only three lines of output displayed in the Java Console
            when the program is run.&nbsp; Ask your lab instructor
            for help if you don't understand what to do.
            <br><br>

   <li> Add an <em>else</em> statement to the first <em>if</em> statement in the
            <em>init()</em> method so that if the boolean expression being tested is false, the
            message "num is less than or exactly 30" is printed in the Java Console.&nbsp; Then run
            the program; you should obtain 4 lines of output in the Java Console for this version.
            <br><br>

   <li> Paste the following code into the bottom of the <em>init()</em> method of your program:
<pre>
            if (person.equals("Judy Garland") ) {
                System.out.println(person + " wears ruby slippers");
            }
            else if (person.equals("Tommy Franks") ) {
                System.out.println(person + " wears army boots");
            }
            else if (person.equals("Omar Vizquel") ) {
                System.out.println(person + " wears baseball cleats");
            }
            else {
                System.out.println(person + " wears black shoes");
            }
</pre>
             Run this program several times, changing the initial value stored in the String object
             <em>person</em> so that different output is obtained for each run.
            <br><br>

   <li> Add another "else if" option to the code above, testing to see if <em>person</em> contains
           the value "Elvis"; if so, display the output that he wears blue suede shoes.&nbsp; When
           you have done this, show your output to your instructor.
            <br><br>

   <li> Close this CodeWarrior project, and create a new Default project in your CS121 folder named
            <strong>lab4a</strong>.&nbsp; Copy the code found at <A HREF="lab4src2.html"> THIS
            LINK</A> into the file named "TheApplet.java".&nbsp; Run the program, and notice that
            this program has three Buttons that can be clicked on the screen, and depending on which
            button is clicked, the appropriate message is displayed on the screen.<br><br>

            Copy the following code into the very beginning of the body of the 
            <em>paint()</em> method in the program:
<pre>
            if (usersChoice == ROCK && computersChoice == PAPER) {
                g.drawString("Paper covers Rock -- I win!", 10, 300);
            }
            else if (usersChoice == PAPER && computersChoice == ROCK) {
                g.drawString("Paper covers Rock -- you win", 10, 300);
            }
            else {
                g.drawString("no winner this time", 10, 300);
            }
</pre>
            Run this program several times, and see if you can win by choosing the PAPER button.&nbsp;
            Also see if you can lose by choosing the ROCK button.
            <br><br>

   <li> Add several more "else if" statements to the <em>paint()</em> method,
           to handle the situations in the Rock, Paper, Scissors game where Scissors cut Paper and
           Rock breaks Scissors.&nbsp; Be sure to handle these cases where the user wins as well as
           when the computer wins.&nbsp; Show this to your instructor when you have a complete
           game working.
